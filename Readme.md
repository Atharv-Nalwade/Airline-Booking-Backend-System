# üëã Welcome to my Microservices Project Repository!

This repository contains all the individual repositories of the microservices that I developed as part of a larger project. The project focuses on creating a microservice-based architecture using JavaScript with NodeJS as a runtime environment. The microservices include a Flight Search Service, an Auth Service, a Reminder Service, an Air Ticket Booking Service, and an API Gateway.
